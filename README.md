Space Invaders 3d
=================

This is destined to be a relatively crude rendition of the old school video game "Space Invaders" using the *Three.js* 
3D Library for _WebGL_.  Currently it is just some rotating shapes in space based on experimentation from book 
_Learning Three.js - the JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL_ byt Jos Dirksen.

To run the app locally fron *nix, simply run the following command from the project root:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer <PORT>`

<PORT> should be 8080 or some other port you aren't currently using and would like to run you dev webserver.

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<PORT>/main.html` and you should see the app running there.

For Windows, one option is to install Node JS and run one of its local webservers.
